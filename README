# Cubendo Colour Palette Editor

A user-friendly React app for managing Cubase/Nuendo colour palettes. Import your `Defaults.xml`, edit up to 32 base colours (with 4 tints each, 128 total), and export a new `Defaults.xml` for use in Cubase/Nuendo. Tested with Cubase 14; earlier versions are unverified.

## Features
- Import your Cubase/Nuendo `Defaults.xml`
- Edit up to 32 base colours, each with 4 tints (128 colours total)
- Preview and adjust colours in a modern UI
- Export and download a new `Defaults.xml` with your updated colour palette
- 100% local: no data is sent to any server; all processing is done in your browser

## Usage

Before use:
- Create a backup of your `Defaults.xml`. On Windows the file typically lives under `%APPDATA%\Steinberg\<Cubase or Nuendo version>\Defaults.xml` (e.g. `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Steinberg\Cubase 14\Defaults.xml`). Keep the copy somewhere safe so you can restore it immediately if needed.
- In Cubase/Nuendo, choose "Save Colour Set as Default" and then close the application. This ensures the file you edit is the one Cubase/Nuendo will pick up on the next launch.

1. Open the app in your web browser.
2. Click **Import XML** and select your `Defaults.xml` file.
3. Edit the colours as desired using the palette tools.
4. Click **Export XML** to download a new `Defaults.xml` with your changes.
5. Replace the `Defaults.xml` in your Cubase/Nuendo directory.
6. In Cubase/Nuendo open the colour settings and choose "Reset colour set to default" â€” this will load the new colour palette.

> **Important:** Use Cubendo only for personal projects you are permitted to modify. Do not distribute modified `Defaults.xml` files if doing so violates Steinberg's terms. If you want to share palettes, export them as JSON; those files contain only colour hex codes, and Cubendo can convert them back into the required `Defaults.xml` structure when you apply them locally.

## Legal & Safety
- Cubendo is a community-built tool that runs entirely in your browser; no palette data leaves your machine.
- The maintainer provides this software without warranties and is not responsible for accidental deletion, data loss, or other damage. You are responsible for verifying backups, testing compatibility, and restoring your configuration if anything goes wrong.
- Always keep a safe copy of your `Defaults.xml` before importing or exporting. Losing that file can affect multiple Cubase/Nuendo settings.
- Use the tool only with files you are authorised to modify. For sharing, prefer JSON exports rather than distributing modified `Defaults.xml` files.
