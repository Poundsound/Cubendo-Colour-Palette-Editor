# Cubase 14 Color Palette Editor

A user-friendly React app for managing Cubase color palettes. This tool allows you to upload your Cubase `Defaults.xml`, edit up to 32 base colors (with 4 tints each, 128 total), and export a new `Defaults.xml` for use in Cubase. This has not been tested on earlier versions.

## Features
- Upload your Cubase `Defaults.xml` file
- Edit up to 32 base colors, each with 4 tints (128 colors total)
- Preview and adjust colors in a modern UI
- Export and download a new `Defaults.xml` with your updated color palette
- No data is sent to any server; all processing is done locally in your browser

## Usage

Before use:
- Create a backup of your `Defaults.xml` (for example `C:\Users\(USERNAME)\AppData\Roaming\Steinberg\Cubase 14`). Keep the copy somewhere safe so you can restore it immediately if needed.
- In Cubase, choose "Save Colour Set as Default" and then close the application. This ensures the file you edit is the one Cubase will pick up next launch.

1. Open the app in your web browser.
2. Click **Upload Defaults.xml** and select your Cubase `Defaults.xml` file. 
3. Edit the colors as desired using the color pickers. 
4. Click **Export** to download a new `Defaults.xml` with your changes.
5. Replace the `Defaults.xml` in your Cubase directorty.
6. In Cubase open the colour settings and choose "reset colour set to default" - this will pull the new colour palette.

> **Important:** Use Cubendo only for personal projects you are permitted to modify. Do not distribute modified `Defaults.xml` files if doing so violates Steinberg's terms. If you want to share palettes, export them as JSON; those files contain only colour hex codes, and Cubendo can convert them back into the required `Defaults.xml` structure when you apply them locally.

## Legal & Safety
- Cubendo is a community-built tool that runs entirely in your browser; no palette data leaves your machine.
- The maintainer provides this software without warranties and is not responsible for accidental deletion, data loss, or other damage. You are responsible for verifying backups, testing compatibility, and restoring your configuration if anything goes wrong.
- Always keep a safe copy of your `Defaults.xml` before importing or exporting. Losing that file can affect multiple Cubase/Nuendo settings.
- Use the tool only with files you are authorised to modify. For sharing, prefer JSON exports rather than distributing modified `Defaults.xml` files.
